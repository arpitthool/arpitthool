### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where I also earned my master's degree. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune, India. With 4 years of diverse experience in the software industry, I have worked across frontend and backend development, DevOps, and testing. Currently, I serve as a Software Engineer on the Virginia Tech ( Blacksburg, VA) Security and Identity Services team, where I contribute to critical security initiatives. My previous experience includes research-focused and software engineering roles, having completed internships at Adobe (Seattle, WA) as a Research Scientist/Engineer and at Lutron (Coopersburg, PA) as a Software Engineer. Additionally, I worked full-time as an Associate Software Engineer at Acquia, gaining extensive hands-on experience in software development.
I have worked with technologies such as Laravel, VueJS, AdonisJS, SvelteKit, and Docker.
