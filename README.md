### Hi there 👋
I am a Graduate Student pursuing PhD. in C.S. at Virginia Tech. Currently working as a Software Engineer for the IT division at Virginia Tech.
With 4 years of work experience, I have previously worked as an associate software engineer at Acquia (India) and a Software Engineer at Lutron (Coopersburg, PA). Through these opportunities, I have gained experience in back-end and front-end development, DevOps, and Testing.
I have worked with technologies such as Laravel, VueJS, AdonisJS, SvelteKit, and Docker.
